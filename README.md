# level.casino

Cloudflare Worker-based casino platform.

## Architecture

Application code lives under `en/`.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled through GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Wrangler.

## Dashboard navigation

Admin and user dashboards use a grouped menu with a menu toggle and an off-canvas drawer on phones. See `docs/DASHBOARD_UI.md`.

## Structure

- `en/worker/` — Worker application
- `en/templates/` — rendering/templates
- `en/static/` — frontend assets
- `en/migrations/` — D1 migrations
- `en/lummet/` — Lummet AI
- `en/schema.sql` — database schema
- `wrangler.jsonc` — Cloudflare configuration

## Analytics / Reporting / Alerting Platform

Event logging, KPI reporting, scheduled reports, and threshold-based
alerting, built on top of the existing item-access/RBAC model — every
query is scoped to what the requesting user can actually see, the same
way the rest of the admin dashboard already works.

### What's tracked

Casino/review/news/page views, offer views, banner views, and
tracking-link clicks/redirects are logged automatically (non-blocking,
via `ctx.waitUntil`) to `analytics_events`. Conversions are recorded via
`POST /api/v1/analytics/conversion/record`, looking up the applicable
`affiliate_commercial_terms` row to calculate commission.

### Dashboard

- `/dashboard/analytics` — KPI cards, performance-by-dimension tables,
  GEO breakdown, open alerts + alert-rule management
- `/dashboard/campaigns` — campaign CRUD
- `/dashboard/reports` — create/run/schedule reports across 17 report
  types (CSV/HTML/JSON export, column selection, grouping with
  subtotals); `seo_performance` is a recognized type with no data
  source configured — it returns a clear error rather than fabricated
  numbers

### Scheduled jobs (all off by default — enable per tenant via `system_settings`)

```sql
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO system_settings (key, value) VALUES ('analytics_aggregation_cron_enabled', 'true');
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO system_settings (key, value) VALUES ('report_schedules_cron_enabled', 'true');
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO system_settings (key, value) VALUES ('alert_rules_cron_enabled', 'true');
```

### Email delivery (scheduled reports)

Provider: [Resend](https://resend.com). Two required secrets, set per
tenant, never committed:
```
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
wrangler secret put RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
```
Without these, email-recipient scheduled reports fail loudly (recorded
in the audit log, `action: 'delivery_failed'`) rather than silently —
in-app notification delivery works regardless.

### Super API (v9)

Tenant-wide, HMAC-signed control-plane access. Capabilities relevant to
this platform: `analytics` (tenant-wide aggregates — overview, revenue,
tracking health), `reports` (list/get/create/run), `campaigns` (full
CRUD), `alerts` (list/create rules, list/acknowledge). See
`en/worker/super/handlers-analytics.js` and `handlers-reporting.js` for
exactly what's exposed and why.

### Migrations

`0027`–`0032` add the analytics/reporting/alerting schema
(`analytics_events`, `analytics_daily`, `analytics_conversions`,
`campaigns`, the reporting-engine tables, and alert tables). `0033`–`0035`
add the postback/import/reconciliation/provider-adapter schema (see below).
Apply in order alongside your existing migrations — same manual,
per-tenant `wrangler d1 execute` process already used for this repo (no
`migrations_dir`/automated D1 migration tracking is configured).

### Tests

```
cd en && npm test
```
Zero npm dependencies — uses Node 22's built-in `node:test` and
`node:sqlite` against the real schema and migrations. 163 tests covering
item-access scoping/leakage prevention, KPI math, report execution,
Super API handlers, email delivery, and the postback/import/
reconciliation/adapter engine below. Wired into CI on push/PR via
`.github/workflows/test.yml`.

## Cron Job Health

Four background jobs (`analytics_aggregation`, `alert_evaluation`,
`provider_sync`, `report_schedules`) all run from the Worker's single
`scheduled()` handler, each gated by its own `system_settings` feature
flag (default off). Two independent things can make a job produce
nothing, and they look identical from the outside ("the dashboard shows
zero") but need completely different fixes:

1. **The trigger itself never fires** — `wrangler.jsonc`'s
   `triggers.crons` must be uncommented and deployed, or `scheduled()`
   is never called by Cloudflare at all, regardless of any flag.
2. **The trigger fires, but the job's flag is off** — intentional
   no-op every time until you `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO system_settings
   (key, value) VALUES ('<job>_cron_enabled', 'true')`.

`/dashboard/analytics` → **System Health** shows exactly which one
you're looking at (`never_run` vs `disabled` vs `stale` vs `ok`) instead
of leaving it to guesswork. The same page has three manual triggers,
none of which require their corresponding `_cron_enabled` flag —
each does real work immediately, useful when you're deliberately not
running Cloudflare Cron Triggers at all (e.g. on a plan that doesn't
include them) and still want these jobs to run on demand:

- **Run Aggregation Now** — backfills `analytics_daily` for any date range.
- **Evaluate Alert Rules Now** — runs every enabled rule once; safe to
  click repeatedly, an already-open alert for the same condition is
  never duplicated.
- **Run Due Scheduled Reports Now** — delivers whatever's actually due
  (`next_run_at <= now`); doesn't force an early run of anything not
  due yet.

Manual runs update the same "last run" tracking the cron path does, so
System Health reflects whichever one actually happened most recently.

No new migration for this — it reuses the existing `system_settings`
key/value table.

## Conversion Postback / Import / Reconciliation Engine

Universal S2S conversion ingestion, on top of the analytics platform
above — same `analytics_conversions` table, same commercial-terms
commission engine, three ingestion transports feeding one pipeline:

- **Live postback**: `POST/GET /api/v1/conversions/postback/:endpoint_token`
  — self-authenticating per integration (HMAC/shared-secret/API-key/
  signed-query), configurable field mapping, replay protection, IP
  allowlisting. Configure via `/dashboard/postback-configs`.
- **CSV/JSON import**: `POST /api/v1/imports/conversions`, same
  attribution/commission/dedup pipeline, per-row error reporting. See
  `/dashboard/import-history`.
- **Outbound provider adapters**: scheduled pulls from a network's own
  reporting API (`system_settings.provider_sync_cron_enabled`, off by
  default). Only a generic, configurable REST adapter ships — no
  network-specific adapter is invented without that network's real,
  documented API. See `/dashboard/provider-adapters` and
  `en/worker/adapters/base.js` for the interface to implement a real one.

All three record `analytics_conversions.source` (`postback` | `manual` |
`import`) and reuse `analytics_conversions.calculated_commission`
(this platform's own figure, from `affiliate_commercial_terms` — never
trusted from a caller) versus `.reported_commission` (only ever set on
imported/statement rows) for the **Reconciliation** report
(`report_type: "reconciliation"`), which compares the two and never
reports a fabricated match when no statement has been imported at all.

**Cohort analysis** (`report_type: "cohort_analysis"`) —
registration→FTD, FTD→deposit, and revenue-by-acquisition-date, grouped
by casino/GEO/campaign — is also on the same reporting engine.

**Player LTV** (`report_type: "ltv_analysis"`) — per-player FTD/deposit
value, 7-day/30-day/lifetime-to-date revenue and commission, keyed by
an optional `external_player_id` (a provider's own player/customer
reference — never derived, decoded, or enriched, per brief §18's PII
guidance). Most conversions won't have one; a tenant with none at all
gets one honest "not available" row instead of a misleadingly empty
table, per the same zero-vs-no-data discipline as reconciliation.

the attribution/dedup rules: **`en/docs/postback-api.md`**.

### Migrations (postback/import/reconciliation/adapters)

`0033` (`postback_configs`, `postback_logs`), `0034` (extends
`analytics_conversions` with `source`/`reported_commission`, adds
`import_batches`), `0035` (`provider_adapter_configs`), `0036` (extends
`analytics_conversions` with `external_player_id`). Same manual
`wrangler d1 execute` process as above.
